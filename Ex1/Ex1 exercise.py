# Ex1: Write a program to count positive and negative numbers in a list
data1 = [-10, -21, -4, -45, -66, 93, 11, -4, -6, 12, 11, 4]

# Ex2: Given a list, extract all elements whose frequency is greater than k.
data2 = [4, 6, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 8]
k = 3

# Ex3: find the strongest neighbour. Given an array of N positive integers.
# The task is to find the maximum for every adjacent pair in the array.
data3 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 9, 11, 2, 10]

# Ex4: print all Possible Combinations from the three Digits
data4 = [1, 2, 3]

# Ex5: Given two matrices (2 nested lists), the task is to write a Python program
# to add elements to each row from initial matrix.
# For example: Input : test_list1 = [[4, 3, 5,], [1, 2, 3], [3, 7, 4]], test_list2 = [[1], [9], [8]]
# Output : [[4, 3, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 9], [3, 7, 4, 8]]
data5_list1 = [
    [4, 3, 5],
    [1, 2, 3],
    [3, 7, 4],
]
data5_list2 = [[1, 3], [9, 3, 5, 7], [8]]

# Ex6:  Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7
# but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Ex7: Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Ex8: Let user type 2 words in English as input. Print out the output
# which is the shortest chain according to the following rules:
# - Each word in the chain has at least 3 letters
# - The 2 input words from user will be used as the first and the last words of the chain
# - 2 last letters of 1 word will be the same as 2 first letters of the next word in the chain
# - All the words are from the file wordsEn.txt
# - If there are multiple shortest chains, return any of them is sufficient
